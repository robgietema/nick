# Users

Available users can be created, queried, updated and deleted by interacting with the `/@users` endpoint on portal root (requires an authenticated user):

## List Users

To retrieve a list of all current users in the portal, call the `/@users` endpoint with a `GET` request:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/list.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/list.ts %}
```

The server will respond with a list of all users in the portal:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/list.res %}
```

This only works for Manager users, anonymous users or logged-in users without Manager rights are now allowed to list users. This is the example as an anonymous user:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/list_anonymous.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/list_anonymous.ts %}
```

The server will return a 401 Unauthorized status code

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/list_anonymous.res %}
```

The endpoint supports some basic filtering:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/list_query.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/list_query.ts %}
```

The server will respond with a list the filtered users in the portal with username starts with the query.

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/list_query.res %}
```

## Create User

To create a new user, send a `POST` request to the global `/@users` endpoint with a JSON representation of the user you want to create in the body:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/post.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/post.ts %}
```

If the user has been created successfully, the server will respond with a status `201 Created`. The `Location` header contains the URL of the newly created user and the resource representation in the payload:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/post.res %}
```

## Read User

To retrieve all details for a particular user, send a `GET` request to the `/@users` endpoint and append the user id to the URL:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/get.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/get.ts %}
```

The server will respond with a `200 OK` status code and the JSON representation of the user in the body:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/get.res %}
```

Only users with Manager rights are allowed to get other users' information:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/get_anonymous.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/get_anonymous.ts %}
```

If the user lacks this rights, the server will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/get_anonymous.res %}
```

If the specified user doesn't exist:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/get_notfound.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/get_notfound.ts %}
```

The server will respond with a `404 Not Found` status code:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/get_notfound.res %}
```

## Update User

To update the settings of a user, send a `PATCH` request with the user details you want to amend to the URL of that particular user, e.g. if you want to update the email address of the admin user to:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/patch.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/patch.ts %}
```

A successful response to a `PATCH` request will be indicated by a `204 No Content` response:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/patch.res %}
```

## Delete User

To delete a user send a `DELETE` request to the `/@users` endpoint and append the user id of the user you want to delete, e.g. to delete the user with the id johndoe:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/delete.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/delete.ts %}
```

A successful response will be indicated by a `204 No Content` response:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/delete.res %}
```

## User Registration

If user registration it is enabled, then an anonymous user can register a new user using the user creation endpoint.

To create a new user send a `POST` request to the `@users` endpoint:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/post_registration.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/post_registration.ts %}
```

If the user should receive an email to set her password, you should pass `"sendPasswordReset": true` in the JSON body of the request. Keep in mind that Plone will send a URL that points to the URL of the Plone site, which might just be your API endpoint.

If the user has been created, the server will respond with a `201 Created` response:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/post_registration.res %}
```

## Reset User Password

Plone allows to reset a password for a user by sending a `POST` request to the user resource and appending `/reset-password` to the URL:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_mail.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_mail.ts %}
```

The server will respond with a `200 OK` response and send an email to the user to reset her password.

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_mail.res %}
```

The token that is part of the reset url in the email can be used to authorize setting a new password:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_set.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_set.ts %}
```

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_set.res %}
```

### Reset Own Password

Users can also reset their own password directly without sending an email. The endpoint and the request is the same as above, but now the user can send the old password and the new password as payload:

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_own.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_own.ts %}
```

The server will respond with a 200 OK response without sending an email.

```http
{% include_relative examples/users/reset_password_own.res %}
```
