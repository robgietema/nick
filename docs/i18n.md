# Internationalization

## i18n: internationalization of screen messages

Nick provides the possibility retrieve screen messages in a different language. To achieve that, the REST API requires to use the `Accept-Language` HTTP header passing as the value the code of the required language.

Using this option we can get the content-type titles translated:

```
{% include_relative examples/types/list_i18n.req %}
```

And the response:

```
{% include_relative examples/types/list_i18n.res %}
```
