```http
{% include_relative examples/history/get.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/history/get.ts %}
```

```http
{% include_relative examples/history/get.res %}
```

This following fields are returned:

- `action`: the workflow transition id, 'Edited' for versioning, or 'Create' for initial state.
- `actor`: the user who performed the action. This contains a subobject with the details.
- `comments`: a changenote
- `@id`: link to the content endpoint of this specific version.
- `may_revert`: true if the user has permission to revert.
