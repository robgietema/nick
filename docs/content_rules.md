# Content Rules

A content rule will automatically perform an action when a certain event, known as a trigger, takes place.

Content rules can perform routine tasks, including the following.

- Move content from one folder to another when that content item is published.
- Send email when a content item is deleted.
- Delete content after a certain date.

Available content rules in a Nick site can be listed and queried by accessing the `/@content-rules` endpoint in any context. Access requires the `Modify` permission.

```http
{% include_relative examples/content_rules/get.req %}
```

Or use the client directly:

```ts
{% include_relative examples/content_rules/get.ts %}
```

Example response:

```http
{% include_relative examples/content_rules/get.res %}
```

The API consumer can assign, unassign, enable, disable, apply to subfolders, or disable apply to subfolders any of the rules available in the portal.
