 * Scheduled tasks can be used to run code at specific intervals or times.
 * This is useful for maintenance tasks, data processing, or any recurring operations.
 * Each task should be defined in its own module and exported here.
 * Each task is an object with the following properties:
 * - name: A unique name for the task.
 * - schedule: A cron-style string defining when the task should run.
 * - handler: A function that contains the code to be executed.
 * @module tasks
